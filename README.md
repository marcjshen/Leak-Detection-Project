# Leak Sensing Project

## Problem Statement
We were tasked with designing a portable leak-detecting device for sewer grates on Rice University's campus. This device should alert Rice's Facilities Engineering & Planning department of water leaks in main pipelines, and should be accurate, durable, and easy to use.
