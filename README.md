# Leak Sensing Project

###ENGI 120 - Freshman Design Course, Fall 2019

## Problem Statement
Each year, Rice University wastes approximately 40 million gallons of water due to pipe leakge, and this costs the university up to $422,400 annually. The task was to design a portable leak-detecting device for sewer grates on Rice University's campus. This device should alert Rice's Facilities Engineering & Planning department of water leaks in main pipelines, and should be accurate, durable, and easy to use.
