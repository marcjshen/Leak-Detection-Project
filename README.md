## Problem Statement
Each year, Rice University wastes approximately 40 million gallons of water due to pipe leakage, and this costs the university up to $422,400 annually. The task was to design a portable leak-detecting device for sewer grates on Rice's campus. This device would alert Rice's Facilities Engineering & Planning department of water leaks in main pipelines, and would be accurate, durable, and easy to use.

## Components
- Raspberry Pi Model 3A+ (with case)
- Adafruit Mini USB Microphone
- Waterproof Polycarbonate Enclosure
- 

## Capabilities

## Future Plans
- adjust threshold and frequency range based on testing
- implement methods of detecting other variables (eg. temperature, flow rate, moisture)
-
